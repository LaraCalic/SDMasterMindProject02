This is the second project - HOTEL BOOKING FORM WEBSITE, that shows how to build up a hotel booking form in HTML and CSS. The website has minor imperfections that could be added later to improve the overall visual appearance of the website. 

The main components of a project consist of: a title, subtitle, background image, and HTML forms with credentials such as name, surname, email, and address of a person. In addition, there is an HTML form that must be filled out to finish the booking. 

The goal of successfully finishing this project is to: learn more about styling options inside the CSS file and how to form input validation works inside the HTML.

The mentioned name of a hotel doesn't exist, and the idea behind this task is to implement basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, focusing more on selectors and classes in CSS.
